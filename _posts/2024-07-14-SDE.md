# Stochastic Differential Equations: A Concise Technical Introduction

**By: An Undergraduate Student**  
*Date: December 30, 2025*

This post provides a technically oriented yet accessible introduction to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) for readers familiar with undergraduate calculus, linear algebra, and basic probability.

## Brownian Motion

Standard Brownian motion (Wiener process) $\{W_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ satisfies:

1. $W_0 = 0$ almost surely,
2. Independent increments: for $0 \leq t_1 < t_2 < \cdots < t_n$, the random variables $W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_k}$ are independent,
3. Gaussian increments: $W_t - W_s \sim \mathcal{N}(0, t-s)$ for $t > s$,
4. Almost surely continuous paths.

The quadratic variation of $W$ on $[0,t]$ is $\langle W \rangle_t = t$ a.s.

## Stochastic Differential Equations

An Itô stochastic differential equation has the form

$$
dX_t = \mu(t, X_t) \, dt + \sigma(t, X_t) \, dW_t, \quad X_0 = x_0,
$$

or in integral form

$$
X_t = x_0 + \int_0^t \mu(s, X_s) \, ds + \int_0^t \sigma(s, X_s) \, dW_s.
$$

The second integral is the Itô stochastic integral, defined as a limit in probability of non-anticipating Riemann sums.

Assume $\mu, \sigma$ satisfy Lipschitz and linear growth conditions:

$$
|\mu(t,x) - \mu(t,y)| + |\sigma(t,x) - \sigma(t,y)| \leq K |x - y|,
$$

$$
|\mu(t,x)| + |\sigma(t,x)| \leq K(1 + |x|).
$$

Then there exists a unique strong solution that is pathwise continuous.

## Itô's Formula

Let $f(t,x) \in C^{1,2}([0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R})$. Then for an Itô process $X_t$,

$$
df(t,X_t) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(t,X_t) \, dt + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(t,X_t) \, dX_t + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}(t,X_t) \, (dX_t)^2,
$$

where the multiplication table is $dt \cdot dt = dt \cdot dW_t = 0$, $dW_t \cdot dW_t = dt$.

Substituting $dX_t = \mu \, dt + \sigma \, dW_t$ yields

$$
df(t,X_t) = \left( f_t + \mu f_x + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 f_{xx} \right) dt + \sigma f_x \, dW_t.
$$

## Example: Geometric Brownian Motion

Consider the SDE for asset prices

$$
dS_t = \mu S_t \, dt + \sigma S_t \, dW_t, \quad S_0 > 0.
$$

Apply Itô's formula to $f(s) = \log s$:

$$
f_s = \frac{1}{s}, \quad f_{ss} = -\frac{1}{s^2}.
$$

Then

$$
d(\log S_t) = \left( \mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \right) dt + \sigma \, dW_t.
$$

Integrating,

$$
\log S_t = \log S_0 + \left( \mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \right) t + \sigma W_t.
$$

Thus

$$
S_t = S_0 \exp\left( \left( \mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \right) t + \sigma W_t \right).
$$

$S_t$ is log-normally distributed with

$$
\mathbb{E}[S_t] = S_0 e^{\mu t}.
$$

## Stratonovich Interpretation (Brief Note)

The alternative Stratonovich SDE

$$
dX_t = \mu(t,X_t) \, dt + \sigma(t,X_t) \circ dW_t
$$

converts to Itô form via

$$
\mu^{\text{Itô}} = \mu^{\text{Strat}} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial x}.
$$
