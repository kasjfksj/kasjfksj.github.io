# Ito's Integral
Recall the stochastic differential equation (SDE) form:

$$
dX_t = \mu(X_t, t)\, dt + \sigma(X_t, t)\, dW_t, \quad X_0 = x_0.
$$

For simplicity, we'll focus on the driving noise term and replace $$dW_t$$ with $$dB_t$$, where $$B_t$$ is a standard Brownian motion (Wiener process).

Integrating both sides gives:

$$
X_T - X_0 = \int_0^T \mu(X_t, t)\, dt + \int_0^T \sigma(X_t, t)\, dB_t.
$$

The first integral is a standard Riemann integral—familiar and deterministic. But the second term is trickier: it's a stochastic integral with respect to the highly irregular paths of Brownian motion. We haven't yet defined what $$\int f(t) \, dB_t$$ even means.

This note builds intuition for why stochastic integration works  by exploring two key properties of Brownian motion paths: total variation and quadratic variation.

## Total Variation

Consider a partition of the interval $$[0, T]$$ into $$n$$ equal parts: $$t_k = k \cdot \Delta t$$, where $$\Delta t = T/n$$ and $$k = 0, 1, \dots, n-1$$.

The **total variation** along this partition is the sum of absolute increments:

$$
V_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |\Delta B_{t_k}| = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |B_{t_{k+1}} - B_{t_k}|,
$$

where each $$\Delta B_{t_k} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Delta t)$$ independently.

Why use absolute values? They measure the "total distance traveled" by the path, regardless of direction.

Now compute the expectation:

Let $$Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Delta t)$$. Then $$\mathbb{E}[|Z|] = \sqrt{\Delta t} \cdot \sqrt{2/\pi}$$.

Thus,

$$
\mathbb{E}[V_n] = n \cdot \sqrt{\Delta t} \cdot \sqrt{2/\pi} = \sqrt{n} \cdot \sqrt{T} \cdot \sqrt{2/\pi} = \sqrt{n T} \cdot \sqrt{2/\pi}.
$$

As $$n \to \infty$$, $$\mathbb{E}[V_n] \to \infty$$.

This shows that the total variation of a Brownian path over $$[0, T]$$ is infinite. The path is continuous but has infinite length—like a fractal curve that wiggles infinitely much at every scale. This is why Brownian paths are nowhere differentiable.

## Quadratic Variation

Now consider the sum of squared increments :

$$
Q_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (\Delta B_{t_k})^2.
$$

This is the **quadratic variation** along the partition.

Expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Q_n] = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \mathbb{E}[(\Delta B_{t_k})^2] = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \Delta t = T.
$$

Variance:

For $$Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Delta t)$$, $$Z^2$$ has variance $$2 (\Delta t)^2$$, so

$$
\mathrm{Var}(Q_n) = n \cdot 2 (\Delta t)^2 = 2 T^2 / n \to 0 \quad \text{as } n \to \infty.
$$

Thus, the quadratic variation of Brownian motion over $$[0, T]$$ is finite and equals 0.

Observe that if $$n \to \infty$$, $$\mathbb{E}[(\Delta B_t)^2]=\Delta t \\ \mathrm{Var}((\Delta B_t)^2)=0$$, we can somehow treat $$(\Delta B_t)^2$$ as a number instead of random variable, which leads to the formula that $$dB_t \cdot dB_t=dt$$
