# Understanding Itô's Formula Intuitively

Recall the SDE form:

$$
dX_t = \mu(X_t, t)\, dt + \sigma(X_t, t)\, dW_t, \quad X_0 = x_0.
$$

For now, we only consider $$dW_t$ to be the increments of brownian motion. To avoid confusion, the rest of the formula will substitute $$$dW_t$ with $$dB_t$$.

Now we can take the integral of the above formula to be 

$$
\int dX_t = \int \mu(X_t, t)\, dt + \int \sigma(X_t, t)\, dB_t
$$



The first part looks exactly the same as ordinary integral when dt is basically a number.

But the real surprise is the second part, which is integrating on random variables (increments in brownian motion). And we haven't define such integration over $$dB_t$$

This note aims to build intuition for that term by focusing on the special properties of Brownian motion $$B_t$$.

## Quadratic Variation of Brownian Motion

Remember that for a brownian motion, an important property of it is that $$B_t-B_s \sim \mathcal{N}(0,t-s), \ \ t>s$$

Now for a given time interval $$[0,T]$$, we can divide the such interval in small interval with $$t_k = \frac{T}{n}k$$ and denote $$\Delta t = \frac{T}{n}$$. Now we can discuss the properties of 

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(B_{t_{k+1}}-B_{t_k})$$, or $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\Delta B_{t_k}$$ where $$\Delta B_{t_k} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\frac{T}{n})$$

So now we divide the brownian motion into a series of random variables

Now calculate it's expectation and variation:

$$\mathbb{E}[\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\Delta B_{t_k}]=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\mathbb{E}[\Delta B_{t_k}]=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}0=0$$

$$Var(\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\Delta B_{t_k})=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}Var(\Delta B_{t_k})=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}$$
