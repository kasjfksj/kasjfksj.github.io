Here, I wanted to share about my experience doing summer research at UIUC (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) this past summer. The whole journey was rather unexpected, and I learned a lot!

​​# An Accidental Start​​
It happened quite by chance. Around March, I was idly browsing our UCI (UC Irvine) Discord server when I saw someone share a post about a UIUC summer research program recruiting students in Software Engineering. Honestly, ​​I barely knew what software engineering was back then​​—I just figured it was something about coding? It seemed pretty distant from my experience. But for some reason, maybe because I was bored that day, or just thought "Why not give it a shot? Nothing to lose," I clicked the link and filled out the application. ​​I had zero expectations, figuring it was a long shot anyway since I had no background in it.​​

​​# The Surprise: I Made the Shortlist!​​
After submitting the application, I pretty much forgot about it. Then, over a month later, I got an email! It said I was being considered for admission! However… there were ​​1,500 other candidates​​ on the shortlist too! Seeing that number made my heart sink—it felt like a lost cause. BUT! The email said admission required completing a task: ​​reading two software engineering papers and writing a critical review/summary.​​

Seeing this task actually gave me a glimmer of hope! It meant they were genuinely reviewing applicants, not just randomly filtering resumes. Sure, the competition was fierce, but at least I had a chance to fight for it. ​​I’d been rejected from two other summer research programs already, which was pretty discouraging, so this time I felt I had to seize the opportunity!​​ So, this total software engineering newbie buckled down and tackled those two papers. Honestly, they were confusing at first—so many terms I didn’t know. I slowly looked things up, piece by piece, and spent a lot of time writing my summaries. ​​In the end… I actually got the acceptance email!​​ I was super excited! It felt like all that effort paid off, and the disappointment from the previous rejections vanished instantly.

​​# The First Meeting: Nerves and a Nice Surprise​​
The project began, and it was time for the first online meeting. ​​When it was my turn for self-introductions, I was incredibly nervous​​—it felt like my heart was going to pound out of my chest. But I managed to stammer through explaining my background. After the meeting, the professor (who was female) added, "Oh, and by the way, I'm a UIUC alum too!" ​​Wow, that was such a pleasant surprise!​​ It instantly made me feel closer to her, like finding a bit of an alumni connection, which eased my nervousness a lot.

​​# Group Work: Initiative Pays Off​​
After the meeting, we divided into groups based on project areas. My group had four people, including me. The professor gave us our first task: ​​read four papers, and everyone needed to write a report.​​

I immediately thought that since we were working together, we needed a place to share materials and discuss. ​​So I took the initiative and asked in the group chat: "Should I set up a GitHub repository? And maybe a Docker environment too, so it's easier for everyone to run code?"​​ No one objected, so I went ahead and did it. Creating the repo, setting permissions, writing a simple Docker setup guide—it was done pretty quickly.

Then came reading the papers and writing the reports. I pushed myself to finish reading them ASAP, trying hard to understand the content. Then, ​​I was the first one to write and submit reports on all four papers onto GitHub.​​ I figured since I was doing it, I might as well be proactive.

​​# The Unexpected Upgrade: Early Lab Admission!​​
Unbelievably, because of those proactive steps (setting up GitHub/Docker and being the first to submit the report), ​​the professor emailed me directly saying I’d passed the preliminary evaluation early! I could formally join their lab immediately to assist a PhD student!​​ This news truly shocked and delighted me! I never expected to join an actual lab project so quickly—it felt like winning the lottery!

​​# Getting Down to Business: Assisting a PhD Student​​
In the lab, I was assigned to help a PhD student. His research area is called "Test Generation," essentially ​​developing ways to make computers automatically generate test cases for software to find bugs.​​ My task was to assist him—writing code, debugging programs, running experiments, that sort of thing.

Honestly, the pressure was on at first, diving into more practical coding and real projects. But being able to genuinely participate in research felt fantastic! ​​Especially seeing code I wrote or problems I helped solve actually being used in the project—that feeling of "I actually helped" was really quite gratifying.​​ Sure, I got stuck sometimes and made mistakes, but the amount I learned was immense. It felt like progress every single day.

​​# Conclusion: A Precious, Unexpected Experience​​
Looking back on this summer, it really feels amazing. ​​From randomly seeing the post on Discord and applying on a whim, to stumbling through reading papers, to getting pulled directly into the lab early just by being proactive…​​ The whole process was full of surprises and delights.

The biggest takeaway is: ​​When an opportunity comes, regardless of whether you feel ready—just go for it!​​ Once you're in a group, take initiative and put in the extra effort—it pays off. Even though I knew nothing about software engineering at the start, this summer research truly immersed me in the field. I learned practical skills and met a bunch of incredibly smart people. ​​This summer research experience at UIUC was definitely my most valuable and most unforgettable gain this su
