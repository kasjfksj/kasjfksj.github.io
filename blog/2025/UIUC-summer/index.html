The entire journey was quite unexpected, and I learned so much!</p> <h1 id="an-accidental-start">​An Accidental Start​​</h1> <p>It happened completely by chance. Around March, I was casually browsing our UCI (University of California, Irvine) Discord server when I saw someone sharing a post about UIUC’s summer research program recruiting software engineering students. Honestly, I barely knew what software engineering was back then—I just thought it involved coding? It seemed worlds away from my background. But for some reason, maybe because I was bored that day or just thought, “Why not give it a try? Nothing to lose,” I clicked the link and filled out the application. I had zero expectations, figuring it was a long shot anyway since I had no relevant background.</p> <h1 id="surprise-i-got-shortlisted">​Surprise: I Got Shortlisted!​​</h1> <p>After submitting the application, I nearly forgot about it. Then, over a month later, I received an email! It said I was under consideration! However… there were 1,500 other candidates on the shortlist! Seeing that number made my heart sink—it felt like a lost cause. But! The email stated admission required completing a task: reading two software engineering papers and writing a critical review/summary.</p> <p>Seeing this task actually gave me a glimmer of hope! It meant they were sincerely evaluating applicants, not just randomly screening resumes. Sure, the competition was fierce, but at least I had a fighting chance. I’d already been rejected by two other summer programs, which was really discouraging, so this time I felt I had to seize this opportunity! So, this complete software engineering novice sat down and tackled the two papers. Honestly, they were confusing at first—so much terminology I didn’t recognize. I slowly looked things up one by one and spent ages writing my summaries. Finally… I actually received the acceptance email! Only 7 were accepted out of 1,500+ applicants! I was super excited! It felt like all the effort had paid off, and the disappointment from earlier rejections instantly vanished.</p> <p>​​First Meeting: Nerves and Surprises​​ The program began, and it was time for the first online meeting. When it was my turn to introduce myself, I was incredibly nervous—my heart felt like it was leaping out of my chest. But I managed to stammer through explaining my background. After the meeting, the professor (who is female) added, “Oh by the way, I’m a UCI alum too!” Wow, what a surprise! It instantly made me feel closer to her, like finding a little alumni connection, which greatly eased my nerves.</p> <h1 id="group-work-proactivity-pays-off">​Group Work: Proactivity Pays Off​​</h1> <p>After the meeting, the professor planned to divide us into two groups based on research background and interests, focusing on different directions. But with the professor being busy, three days passed without the groups being formed. Without groups finalized, we couldn’t confirm research topics, so I took the initiative to propose groupings. The professor then followed up quickly, finalized the groups, and assigned our first task: reading four papers.</p> <p>I immediately thought that since we were working together, we needed a place to share materials and discuss. So, I proactively asked in the group chat: “Should I set up a GitHub repository? Maybe also a Docker environment to make it easier for everyone to run code?” Creating the repo, setting up permissions, and writing a simple Docker setup guide—all were done very quickly.</p> <p>Then came reading the papers and writing reports. I pushed myself to finish them ASAP, striving to understand the content. Then, I was the first to submit reports for all four papers to GitHub. I figured since I was doing this, I might as well be proactive. Through reading the four papers and the project kick-off documents the professor shared, I gradually gained clarity about the summer project’s goal: The professor already had a tool to translate C programs to Rust, but needed comprehensive test cases to verify translation accuracy. I shared this understanding with the professor and got a very positive response: “​​You are so right​​,” acknowledging my perspective.</p> <h1 id="unexpected-upgrade-joining-the-lab-early">​Unexpected Upgrade: Joining the Lab Early!​​</h1> <p>Unbelievably, because of these proactive steps (pushing for group formation, setting up GitHub/Docker, being the first to submit reports, and correctly identifying the project’s goal), the professor replied directly, saying I had ​​passed the preliminary evaluation early!​​ I could ​​officially join their lab immediately!​​ This news genuinely shocked and delighted me! I never imagined joining a real lab project so quickly—it felt like winning the lottery!</p> <h1 id="starting-the-lab-work-assisting-the-team">​Starting the Lab Work: Assisting the Team​​</h1> <p>The professor introduced me to the lab members, but they all seemed too busy to respond initially.</p> <p>Based on my understanding of the project’s goal—generating comprehensive test cases to verify the accuracy of C-to-Rust translation—I started diving deep into possible solutions. After researching, I discovered that some test case generation tools and validation scripts could be used. I compiled this research into a feasibility report and shared it. Unexpectedly, this drew ​​significant attention from the professor and other project members​​. Clearly, I had brought a new perspective to the project. Knowing my effort was helping the team made me incredibly excited.</p> <p>Honestly, the initial pressure was intense—immersing myself in practical coding and a real-world project. But being able to genuinely contribute to research felt amazing! Especially seeing my investigation or solutions I helped develop being used in the project—that feeling of “I actually helped” was truly rewarding. Sure, I got stuck and made mistakes sometimes, but what I learned was immense. It felt like progress every day.</p> <h1 id="conclusion-a-precious-unexpected-experience">​Conclusion: A Precious, Unexpected Experience​​</h1> <p>This incredible summer is still ongoing and truly feels wonderful. From randomly spotting a post on Discord and applying on a whim, to stumbling through reading papers, to being pulled straight into the lab early just for being proactive, to having my efforts help the lab… the whole process has been full of surprises and joy.</p> <p>The biggest takeaway: ​​When an opportunity comes, whether you feel ready or not—go for it!​​ Once you’re in a team, be proactive and put in extra effort—it pays off. Even though I knew nothing about software engineering initially, this summer research truly immersed me in the field. I learned practical skills and met incredibly smart people. This summer research experience at UIUC will absolutely be the most valuable and unforgettable highlight of my year.</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Xiaoyang Li.
